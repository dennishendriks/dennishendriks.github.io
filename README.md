## Dennis Hendriks Portfolio 2017

My project portfolio is build with reactJS. The website is fully responsive.
I used css(scss) to add some effects and animations.

The project uses Jarn to install the dependencies and Webpack to bundle the .js and .scss files.


### TODO
* Test Components -> JEST?
* Update url specified on opened item or filtered page
* Optimize performance
* Fix deprecated Synchronous XMLHttpRequest -> in getBlocks() function
* Fix some crossbrowser bugs
- IE9 not showing popup
* Make items focus/tabbable

#### Nice to have
* Create backend to serve items in JSON -> Django or Wordpress?
* Add English translation -> load another JSON on switch
* Use native video player instead of youtube
